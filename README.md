## Steganography in Python  

This project implements a simple steganography technique to hide a secret message inside an image using OpenCV.  

### Features  

- Encodes a secret message into an image by modifying pixel values.  
- Uses a passcode for decryption to ensure security.  
- Saves the encrypted image as encryptedImage.jpg.  
- Retrieves and prints the hidden message if the correct passcode is entered.  

### Prerequisites  

Make sure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:  

bash
pip install opencv-python


### Usage  

1. Place the image you want to use in the project folder. Update the script with the correct image filename if needed.  
2. Run the script:  

  
   python stego.py
